			<p> My name is Brianna Navarro and I’m a student of Skyline and CSM college. I have been in Skyline for 3 years online and on campus and in CSM for 2 years online. My interests are playing video games on different electronics and collecting expensive lego sets but mostly just video games. The place I like to go on vacation is at Las Vegas where we have a time share at one of the resorts close to the city. During this pandemic, I like having to work at home because you get to work in your own space that feels comfortable to you, do assignments on your own time, and don’t have to be in a space full of people making it more relaxing and easier to focus on assignments. </p>

				<p> I am attending this class because I want to learn and experience different techniques and skills on creating websites or mobile apps through different softwares. The first software I learned how to use was Sublimtext where I created websites and now I am learning to use Github as my next software to create mobile apps and websites. I am also hoping to learn how to use other softwares in the future that are not just to create websites, but to also learn other ways on working through computers. Ever since Covid started, it made me start using my computer more often now when doing online classes and had me thinking of what other possibilities I can do on the computer which is what started me to take all of these other different computer classes.</p>
